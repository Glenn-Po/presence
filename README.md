presence is a mvp attendance management system for a company called cimara.

Presence Admins can create, edit, and delete user account. The locations of the workplaces are represented with geocoordintaes and a qr code is generated for each location when it is created


Presence provides and interface for employees to 'sign the attendance register' by scanning a qr code when at the workplae premises. This is the QR code that is autogenerated when the admin adds that workplace location. The code is retrieved as well as the employees geolocation and matched with the database date to ensure authentic clocking.

An employee clocks in and out for a day and their attendance is registered for admins to review.

Admins can filter attendances by data as well as view employee attendances on a custom calendar
